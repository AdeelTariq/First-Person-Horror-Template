This is a First Person Horror Game template for **Godot 4.5** that I made for myself and decided to open source.
_Feel free to request features._

Right now the template includes:

- A feature rich first person controller
- My interaction system (also WIP)
- An abstraction layer between your input system and your game, named: Game Controls
- A Prompt Formatter that helps display input prompts
- A modified version of Maaack's menu template
- A bare bones test scene.
- Interactable Game Pieces like doors, drawers and physics objects
- Amnesia style doors and drawer interactions
- An automatic credits generator


**Core principle and goal of this template is to be modular.**
So you can delete any part of it you don't want or replace any part with your own custom solution.
I guess that may come at the cost of complexity, so I'll try to add explainations to each module as much as possible.
